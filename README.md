 This is my main repository showcasing all the class work I've done while attending Eastern Washington University.


# Brief Summary
 What I love about going to school for Computer Science is learning how exactly technology can be used to solve our daily problems. 
 
 On my journey to achieving my B.S in Computer Science, you'll be able to follow my progress and spectate the manner in which I problem solve for my assignments.
